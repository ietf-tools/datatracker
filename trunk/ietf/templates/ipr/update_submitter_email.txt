Subject: IPR update notification

Dear {{ to_name }}:

We have just received a request to update the IPR disclosure(s) submitted by you:

{% for ipr in iprs %}
{{ ipr.title }} {{ ipr.get_absolute_url }}
{% endfor %}

The name and email address of the person who submitted the update to your IPR disclosure are:
{{ new_ipr.submitter_name }}, {{ new_ipr.submitter_email }}.

We will not post this update unless we receive positive confirmation from you that
{{ new_ipr.submitter_name }} is authorized to update your disclosure.
Please respond to this message to confirm.

If we do not hear from you within 30 days, we will inform {{ new_ipr.submitter_name }}
that we were not able to secure approval for posting and that we are therefore rejecting
the update until we can be assured it is authorized.

Thank you

IETF Secretariat
