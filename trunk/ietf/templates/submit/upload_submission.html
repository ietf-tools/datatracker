  <p>This page is used to submit Internet-Drafts to the
    Internet-Draft repository. The list of current Internet-Drafts can be
    accessed at <a href="https://www.ietf.org/ietf/1id-abstracts.txt">https://www.ietf.org/ietf/1id-abstracts.txt</a></p>

  <p>Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
    Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups. Note that other
    groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-Drafts.</p>

  <p>Internet-Drafts are draft documents, and are valid for a maximum of
    six months. They may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other
    documents at any time.</p>

    <p>If you run into problems when submitting an Internet-Draft
      using this and the following pages, you may alternatively submit
      your draft by email to
      <a href="mailto:internet-drafts@ietf.org">internet-drafts@ietf.org</a>.
      However, be advised that manual processing always takes additional time.</p>
