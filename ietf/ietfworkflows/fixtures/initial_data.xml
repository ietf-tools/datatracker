   The "Call for Adoption by WG Issued" state should be used to indicate
   when an I-D is being considered for adoption by an IETF WG.  An I-D
   that is in this state is actively being considered for adoption and
   has not yet achieved consensus, preference, or selection in the WG.

   This state may be used to describe an I-D that someone has asked a WG
   to consider for adoption, if the WG Chair has agreed with the
   request.  This state may also be used to identify an I-D that a WG
   Chair asked an author to write specifically for consideration as a
   candidate WG item [WGDTSPEC], and/or an I-D that is listed as a
   'candidate draft' in the WG's charter.

   Under normal conditions, it should not be possible for an I-D to be
   in the "Call for Adoption by WG Issued" state in more than one
   working group at the same time.  This said, it is not uncommon for
   authors to "shop" their I-Ds to more than one WG at a time, with the
   hope of getting their documents adopted somewhere.

   After this state is implemented in the Datatracker, an I-D that is in
   the "Call for Adoption by WG Issued" state will not be able to be
   "shopped" to any other WG without the consent of the WG Chairs and
   the responsible ADs impacted by the shopping.

   Note that Figure 1 includes an arc leading from this state to outside
   of the WG state machine.  This illustrates that some I-Ds that are
   considered do not get adopted as WG drafts.  An I-D that is not
   adopted as a WG draft will transition out of the WG state machine and
   revert back to having no stream-specific state; however, the status
   change history log of the I-D will record that the I-D was previously
   in the "Call for Adoption by WG Issued" state.

   The "Adopted by a WG" state describes an individual submission I-D
   that an IETF WG has agreed to adopt as one of its WG drafts.

   WG Chairs who use this state will be able to clearly indicate when
   their WGs adopt individual submission I-Ds.  This will facilitate the
   Datatracker's ability to correctly capture "Replaces" information for
   WG drafts and correct "Replaced by" information for individual
   submission I-Ds that have been replaced by WG drafts.

   This state is needed because the Datatracker uses the filename of an
   I-D as a key to search its database for status information about the
   I-D, and because the filename of a WG I-D is supposed to be different
   from the filename of an individual submission I-D.
   The filename of an individual submission I-D will typically be
   formatted as 'draft-author-wgname-topic-nn'.

   The filename of a WG document is supposed to be formatted as 'draft-
   ietf-wgname-topic-nn'.

   An individual I-D that is adopted by a WG may take weeks or months to
   be resubmitted by the author as a new (version-00) WG draft.  If the
   "Adopted by a WG" state is not used, the Datatracker has no way to
   determine that an I-D has been adopted until a new version of the I-D
   is submitted to the WG by the author and until the I-D is approved
   for posting by a WG Chair.

   The "Adopted for WG Info Only" state describes a document that
   contains useful information for the WG that adopted it, but the
   document is not intended to be published as an RFC.  The WG will not
   actively develop the contents of the I-D or progress it for
   publication as an RFC.  The only purpose of the I-D is to provide
   information for internal use by the WG.

   The "WG Document" state describes an I-D that has been adopted by an
   IETF WG and is being actively developed.

   A WG Chair may transition an I-D into the "WG Document" state at any
   time as long as the I-D is not being considered or developed in any
   other WG.

   Alternatively, WG Chairs may rely upon new functionality to be added
   to the Datatracker to automatically move version-00 drafts into the
   "WG Document" state as described in Section 4.1.

   Under normal conditions, it should not be possible for an I-D to be
   in the "WG Document" state in more than one WG at a time.  This said,
   I-Ds may be transferred from one WG to another with the consent of
   the WG Chairs and the responsible ADs.

   A "Parked WG Document" is an I-D that has lost its author or editor,
   is waiting for another document to be written or for a review to be
   completed, or cannot be progressed by the working group for some
   other reason.

   Some of the annotation tags described in Section 4.3 may be used in
   conjunction with this state to indicate why an I-D has been parked,
   and/or what may need to happen for the I-D to be un-parked.

   Parking a WG draft will not prevent it from expiring; however, this
   state can be used to indicate why the I-D has stopped progressing in
   the WG.

   A "Parked WG Document" that is not expired may be transferred from
   one WG to another with the consent of the WG Chairs and the
   responsible ADs.

   A "Dead WG Document" is an I-D that has been abandoned.  Note that
   'Dead' is not always a final state for a WG I-D.  If consensus is
   subsequently achieved, a "Dead WG Document" may be resurrected.  A
   "Dead WG Document" that is not resurrected will eventually expire.

   Note that an I-D that is declared to be "Dead" in one WG and that is
   not expired may be transferred to a non-dead state in another WG with
   the consent of the WG Chairs and the responsible ADs.

   A document "In WG Last Call" is an I-D for which a WG Last Call
   (WGLC) has been issued and is in progress.

   Note that conducting a WGLC is an optional part of the IETF WG
   process, per Section 7.4 of RFC 2418 [RFC2418].

   If a WG Chair decides to conduct a WGLC on an I-D, the "In WG Last
   Call" state can be used to track the progress of the WGLC.  The Chair
   may configure the Datatracker to send a WGLC message to one or more
   mailing lists when the Chair moves the I-D into this state.  The WG
   Chair may also be able to select a different set of mailing lists for
   a different document undergoing a WGLC; some documents may deserve
   coordination with other WGs.

   A WG I-D in this state should remain "In WG Last Call" until the WG
   Chair moves it to another state.  The WG Chair may configure the
   Datatracker to send an e-mail after a specified period of time to
   remind or 'nudge' the Chair to conclude the WGLC and to determine the
   next state for the document.

   It is possible for one WGLC to lead into another WGLC for the same
   document.  For example, an I-D that completed a WGLC as an
   "Informational" document may need another WGLC if a decision is taken
   to convert the I-D into a Standards Track document.

   A WG Chair may wish to place an I-D that receives a lot of comments
   during a WGLC into the "Waiting for WG Chair Go-Ahead" state.  This
   state describes an I-D that has undergone a WGLC; however, the Chair
   is not yet ready to call consensus on the document.

   If comments from the WGLC need to be responded to, or a revision to
   the I-D is needed, the Chair may place an I-D into this state until
   all of the WGLC comments are adequately addressed and the (possibly
   revised) document is in the I-D repository.

   A document in the "WG Consensus: Waiting for Writeup" state has
   essentially completed its development within the working group, and
   is nearly ready to be sent to the IESG for publication.  The last
   thing to be done is the preparation of a protocol writeup by a
   Document Shepherd.  The IESG requires that a document shepherd
   writeup be completed before publication of the I-D is requested.  The
   IETF document shepherding process and the role of a WG Document
   Shepherd is described in RFC 4858 [RFC4858]

   A WG Chair may call consensus on an I-D without a formal WGLC and
   transition an I-D that was in the "WG Document" state directly into
   this state.

   The name of this state includes the words "Waiting for Writeup"
   because a good document shepherd writeup takes time to prepare.

   This state describes a WG document that has been submitted to the
   IESG for publication and that has not been sent back to the working
   group for revision.

   An I-D in this state may be under review by the IESG, it may have
   been approved and be in the RFC Editor's queue, or it may have been
   published as an RFC.  Other possibilities exist too.  The document
   may be "Dead" (in the IESG state machine) or in a "Do Not Publish"
   state.
