    The IESG will use RFC 5742 responses: 1) The IESG has concluded
    that there is no conflict between this document and IETF work; 2)
    The IESG has concluded that this work is related to IETF work done
    in WG &lt;X&gt;, but this relationship does not prevent
    publishing; 3) The IESG has concluded that publication could
    potentially disrupt the IETF work done in WG &lt;X&gt; and
    recommends not publishing the document at this time; 4) The IESG
    has concluded that this document violates IETF procedures for
    &lt;Y&gt; and should therefore not be published without IETF
    review and IESG approval; or 5) The IESG has concluded that this
    document extends an IETF protocol in a way that requires IETF
    review and should therefore not be published without IETF review
    and IESG approval.<br/>
    <br />
    The document shepherd must propose one of these responses in the
    document write-up in the Data Tracker, and the document shepherd
    may supply text for an IESG Note in the write-up. The Area
    Director ballot positions indicate consensus with the response
    proposed by the document shepherd and agreement that the IESG
    should request inclusion of the IESG Note.<br/>
    <br />
    Other matters may be recorded in comments, and the comments will
    be passed on to the RFC Editor as community review of the document.
