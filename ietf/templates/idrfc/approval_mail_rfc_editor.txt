Subject: Re: {{ status }} to be: {{ doc.file_tag|safe }}
{% filter wordwrap:73 %}{% if disapproved %}
The IESG recommends that '{{ doc.title }}' {{ doc.file_tag|safe }} NOT be published as {{ full_status }}.
{% else %}
The IESG has no problem with the publication of '{{ doc.title }}' {{ doc.file_tag|safe }} as {{ full_status }}.

The IESG would also like the IRSG or RFC-Editor to review the comments in the datatracker ({{ doc_url }}) related to this document and determine whether or not they merit incorporation into the document. Comments may exist in both the ballot and the comment log.{% endif %}

A URL of this {{ doc_type }} is:
{{ doc_url }}

The process for such documents is described at http://www.rfc-editor.org/indsubs.html

Thank you,

The IESG Secretary
