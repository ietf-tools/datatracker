    This page provides a mechanism for filing disclosures about intellectual
    property rights (IPR) and for finding out what IPR disclosures have been
    filed.  The IETF intellectual property rights rules are defined in RFC
    8179, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8179.txt">"Intellectual
    Property Rights in IETF Technology"</a>.

  </p>
  <p>

    The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any
    intellectual property rights or other rights that might be claimed to
    pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in any
    IETF documents or the extent to which any license under such rights might
    or might not be available; nor does it represent that it has made any
    independent effort to identify any such rights.

  <p>

    The material posted as IPR disclosures should be viewed as originating
    from the source of that information, and any issue or question related to
    the material should be directed to the source rather than the IETF. There
    is no implied endorsement or agreement by the IETF, the IESG or any other
    IETF entities with any of the material.
