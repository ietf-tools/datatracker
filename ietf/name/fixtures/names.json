Call for Adoption by WG Issued</a>\n\n The \"Call for Adoption by WG Issued\" state should be used to indicate when an I-D is being considered for adoption by an IETF WG. An I-D that is in this state is actively being considered for adoption and has not yet achieved consensus, preference, or selection in the WG.\n\n This state may be used to describe an I-D that someone has asked a WG to consider for adoption, if the WG Chair has agreed with the request. This state may also be used to identify an I-D that a WG Chair asked an author to write specifically for consideration as a candidate WG item [WGDTSPEC], and/or an I-D that is listed as a 'candidate draft' in the WG's charter.\n\n Under normal conditions, it should not be possible for an I-D to be in the \"Call for Adoption by WG Issued\" state in more than one working group at the same time. This said, it is not uncommon for authors to \"shop\" their I-Ds to more than one WG at a time, with the hope of getting their documents adopted somewhere.\n\n After this state is implemented in the Datatracker, an I-D that is in the \"Call for Adoption by WG Issued\" state will not be able to be \"shopped\" to any other WG without the consent of the WG Chairs and the responsible ADs impacted by the shopping.\n\n Note that Figure 1 includes an arc leading from this state to outside of the WG state machine. This illustrates that some I-Ds that are considered do not get adopted as WG drafts. An I-D that is not adopted as a WG draft will transition out of the WG state machine and revert back to having no stream-specific state; however, the status change history log of the I-D will record that the I-D was previously in the \"Call for Adoption by WG Issued\" state.",

This will facilitate the Datatracker's ability to correctly capture \"Replaces\" information for WG drafts and correct \"Replaced by\" information for individual submission I-Ds that have been replaced by WG drafts.\n\n This state is needed because the Datatracker uses the filename of an I-D as a key to search its database for status information about the I-D, and because the filename of a WG I-D is supposed to be different from the filename of an individual submission I-D. The filename of an individual submission I-D will typically be formatted as 'draft-author-wgname-topic-nn'.\n\n The filename of a WG document is supposed to be formatted as 'draft- ietf-wgname-topic-nn'.\n\n An individual I-D that is adopted by a WG may take weeks or months to be resubmitted by the author as a new (version-00) WG draft. If the \"Adopted by a WG\" state is not used, the Datatracker has no way to determine that an I-D has been adopted until a new version of the I-D is submitted to the WG by the author and until the I-D is approved for posting by a WG Chair.",

Or, the shepherding AD may attempt to argue that the issue is not serious enough to bring to the attention of the authors/WG.\n\n- if a documented issue is forwarded to a WG, some further iteration may be needed before it can be determined whether a new revision is needed or whether the WG response to an issue clarifies the issue sufficiently.\n\n- when a new revision appears, the shepherding AD will first look at the changes to determine whether they believe all outstanding issues have been raised satisfactorily, prior to asking the ADs who raised the original issues to verify the changes.",
