## Typing stubs for bleach

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`bleach`](https://github.com/mozilla/bleach) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
[Pyre](https://pyre-check.org/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses `bleach`. This version of
`types-bleach` aims to provide accurate annotations for
`bleach==6.2.*`.

This package is part of the [typeshed project](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.
See [the README](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md)
for more details. The source for this package can be found in the
[`stubs/bleach`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/bleach)
directory.

This package was tested with
mypy 1.15.0,
pyright 1.1.400,
and pytype 2024.10.11.
It was generated from typeshed commit
[`9589e369f8afdd2980e45953e2ca9f2055d74c10`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/9589e369f8afdd2980e45953e2ca9f2055d74c10).
