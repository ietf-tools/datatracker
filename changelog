ietfdb (2.17)

  * Fixed the agena problem where breaks would not have the right name.  Also
    refactor and simplify the agenda code and templates.  Requires some database
    changes, too.

  * Made the liaison statement list inherit from base.html, to have the same style

  * Changed to table layout for the base page.  Not puristic, but the non-table
    approach had problems with some pages, (some content being forced to start
    below the lefthand menu even when there was space higher up), and I could see
    no easy way to fix it.

  * Added the text from the original IPR declaration to the detail page for
    declarations submitted by mail.  Made the link to the email text page more
    prominent. Fixed some html issues.

  * Added a link to the meeting agenda to the lefthand menu, and did some minor
    fixes to the html.

  * Added more people to the autogenerated release mail.

  * Added a machine-readable view listing IPR declarations per draft/rfc

    version of drafts)

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  12 Feb 2009 13:22:08 +0100

  * Added to the mkrelease script the generation of a mail about the
    release to various interested parties.

  * Changed the IDtracker's 'not in the tracker' error message, as it
    sounded a bit as if there was no record of the draft in question.

    from Pasi Eronen <pasi.eronen@nokia.com>

    hardcoded IP address when it should be empty.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  06 Nov 2008 17:20:49 +0100

ietfdb (2.11)

    menu-bar.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  06 Nov 2008 17:20:49 +0100

ietfdb (2.10)

  * Changed look-and-feel of the datatracker, by introducing a different
    style sheet, and using a more consistent style, and introducing a
    lefthand menubar.

    information.  Tweaked the format of returned docstate information
    to not have spaces around the :: separator between state and substate.

  * Fixed the help page for ballot symbols, which had a very old text
    which no longer was correct.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  06 Nov 2008 17:20:49 +0100

  http://tools.ietf.org/tools/ietfdb/log/branch/2.00?rev=1161&stop_rev=1070

  * Adjustments to the default settings, to match the new deployment environment
    at AMS

  * Template updates for agendas: 
      - Use python, not template-language, to decide if the month is
	different.  
      - Don't use "odate" and add a space where   appropriate.  
      - Use a datetime and time zone instead of hardcoding (ET).
	(let the model combine the date and the time)

  * Per suggestion from John Klensin, add a link directly to the text of the
    I-D, but only give the explicit link to the draft if it's active.

  * Expanded description of a document on the agenda.

  * Added authorization infrastructure.  No impact on current functionality,
    but needed for future features.

  * Added a feed for documents on the IESG telechat.  Improved the admin
    interface for iesg_login and irtf rg's and chairs.

  * /meeting/ now redirects to meeting/<current>/materials.html

  * Licencing information added.  IETF Trust copyright added as needed.
