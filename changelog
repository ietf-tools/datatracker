ietfdb (3.55)

  This release adds the wgchair tracker functionality, and also contains
  some bugfixes.

  Feature:

  * Merged in branch branch/yaco/wgchairs from esanchez@yaco.es.  This 
    provides the WG Chair Tracker functionality.

  Fixes:

  * Changed the default initial state for a WG document to 'WG Document', 
    instead of 'Call for Adoption ...'.

  * Labelled the link to edit a document's WG state 'Change WG State', in 
    order to not confuse it with changing the IESG state.

  * Reordered the state information for a document into related groups, 
    separated by rulers.  Add some indentation to the template code to make it 
    a bit easier to read in some places.

  * Made the WG a draft belongs to into a link to the WG page.

  * Corrected an inappropriate use of the idsubmission repository location 
    instead of the ID repository.  Reported by Robert Sparks.

  * Correct the text (add an omitted word 'press').  Reported by Tomas Narten.

  * Fixed a problem with author extraction when a given name is the same as 
    the surname.

  * Only try to return a shepherd for a document if one has been assigned 
    to the document.

  * Merged in changes from esanchez@yaco.es, changeset [3067].  Makes 
    Liaisons' Date field editable.

  * Added a bit of admin goodness for MeetingSessions.

  From rjsparks@nostrum.com:

  * Restructured the position editing page to better integrate the defer button.
    Fixes bug #659

  * Copied the jquery-1.5.1.min.js library into /static/js/lib (from
    /static/js) because that's where the main document template was looking for
    it. There have probably been several problems since the change that left
    this dangling that showed up as things not behaving, but not as errors. The
    one that clued me in was the discuss text-box not being hidden when the
    position wasn't DISCUSS.  They should all behave better now.

  * Added a django form validator to the discuss text field to not allow
    actions when the position is Discuss, but the discuss-text is empty.  2 and
    3 together fix bug #660

  * Added logic to the undefer fuction to put the document back on the
    previous telechat (if that hasn't already passed). That is, date1 from
    telechat dates, and not date2.  Fixes bug #661

  * Changed the last_call_announcement generation function's template to
    include the abstracts from the document sets (which with modern usage means
    the abstract of the document) reflecting the IESGs decision of a few months
    back.  Fixes bug #662

  * Removed the old tracker link from the document's main page. Fixes bug #663 

  From henrik@levkowetz.com:

  * Handle email recipient lists which contain 'None' elements correctly.
    Fixes an instance of failure to send notifications about a submitted
    draft where an author email address was missing.

  * Add an admin interface to the I-D submission app, to make it easier to
    handle manual tasks related to submissions.

  * Add the submission hash to initial-revision-approval emails to WG chairs,
    so their approvals will take effect.  Fixes a problem where WG Chair
    approvals of WG draft submissions didn't take effect

  * Apply 'autoescape off' to all email templates which don'have it but 
    might need it, to avoid html entity escapes in emails.  Fixes another
    set of instances where this potentially could occur.

  * We cannot currently assume that BallotInfo entries matching 
    IDInternal.ballot exists. It seems ballot may be set to a value before the 
    actual ballot entry is created, possibly by some old secretariat tool. Very 
    broken, but we need to survive it :-(  Fixes a crash in the admin
    interface.

  * Reordered entries of submission forms and notification emails to be
    more appropriate.

  * Changed wrapping of formatted text to expand tabs during text wrapping, in
    order to get consistent indentation handling.

  From esanches@yaco.es:

  * Do not allow cancellation of submissions with GET requests, and Ensure
    that 'get full url', 'approve' and 'force' views are called via POST
    request. Insert a button to perform the last step of autopost via POST
    request. Fixes #650  

  * Do not assume that the two_pages_field field is not None. Fixes #651

  * Allow creation dates that are 3 days after or 3 days before the current
    date. Fixes #652

  * Change substate from Revised ID Needed to AD Followup if needed. Fixes #654

  * Fix expected revision for expired drafts. Fixes #656

  * Send announcements when posting new version of a draft. Fixes #649

  From henrik@levkowetz.com:

  * Previous IPR information in last call announcements could be 
    incomplete.  Use a better search for IPR declarations related to a 
    document, and include the IPR information in the last call preview.
    Fixes an AD request and a request from the IESG

  * When extracting meta-information from drafts, it is required that some 
    data reside on the first page.  Split unpaginated drafts into chunks so we 
    can adhere better to this.  Fixes a bug where submission filename was
    picked up (incorrectly) later in a document.

  * Wrap long lines in the 'save and send email' view of AD ballot comments 
    and discusses.  Fixes a request from the IESG

  * Give development and test deployment a /robots.txt which doesn't permit 
    robots.  Avoids indexing of development servers by web spiders.

  * A very small bugfix release, providing the ability for secretariat staff
    to post liaisons on behalf of others, and when doing so assuming the
    powers of the liaison manager they are posting for.  This contains the
    changes that should have been part of 3.51, but wasn't...

  * A very small bugfix release, providing the ability for secretariat staff
    to post liaisons on behalf of others, and when doing so assuming the
    powers of the liaison manager they are posting for.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  13 Apr 2011 16:20:21 +0200

ietfdb (3.50)

  * For this release, the idsubmit port from esanchez@yaco.es has been merged
    in, which constitute substantial added functionality.  This integrates the
    draft upload functionality with the python/django datatracker; it improves
    draft submission handling and security, and fixes problems with database
    breakage and inconsistency caused by the old implementation.  With this also
    comes a major improvement of author extraction from draft text, provided by
    the ietf/utils/draft.py module from henrik@levkowetz.com.

  * Deployment note:  Once the new release has been placed in its deployment
    directory, and the correct settings_local.py has been copied in, a command
    needs to be run in order to update the database tables to work with the new
    code.  In the directory containing the ietf/ directory, run this command:

        $ PYTHONPATH=$PWD ietf/manage.py migrate

    The output should be as follows:

	Running migrations for liaisons:
	- Nothing to migrate.
	Running migrations for submit:
	 - Migrating forwards to 0003_add_extra_name_fields.
	 > submit: 0001_initial
	 > submit: 0002_add_submission_hash
	 > submit: 0003_add_extra_name_fields
	 - Loading initial data for submit.

    Once this is done, the regular deployment routine should be continued.

ietfdb (3.16)

  This is a minor bugfix release.

  * Merged in [3029] from esanchez@yaco.es.  Make the Cc: field of new 
    liaisons editable.

  * Set the 'person' field of the LegacyLiaisonUser in the admin interface 
    to be handled as a raw id field with search button, rather than as a choice 
    list.  This should make admin updates involving the LegacyLiaisonUser table
    much speedier.

  * Added a new fix for empty query strings to /meeting/agenda/agenda.ics.  
    (The QUERY_STRING in request.META is not set the same way under the builtin
    server as under Apache; under apache there will be a QUERY_STRING entry wich
    is explicitly Null.  Handles this.)

  * Included a javascript change not previsously merged in from branch/yaco/liaison/.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  07 Apr 2011 17:15:41 +0200

ietfdb (3.15)

  This is a minor bugfix release.

  * Fix the weekday-dependent plenary information in the materials list.

  * In urls under /wg/, only accept wgnames which adhere to the constraints
    currently practiced.  (Before this change, the URL patterns would match wg
    names containing non-ascii characters, which later would bomb due to mix of
    collations when accessing the database. Might as well return a 404 at once
    instead).

  * Don't return 500 if the /meeting/agenda/agenda.ics URL is without query part.

  * Get rid of a print statement used during testing.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  06 Apr 2011 15:17:11 +0200

ietfdb (3.14)

  * From lars.eggert@nokia.com: 
    Update jQuery to 1.5.1 and jQuery UI to 1.8.11.

  * From adam@nostrum.com: 
    On the agenda page, for the custom agenda display, now only displays groups
    that are actually meeting.

  * From lars.eggert@nokia.com: 
    Remove unused images. Convert GIFs to smaller PNGs.
    Optimize all images with http://www.smushit.com/ysmush.it/ 

  * From lars.eggert@nokia.com: 
    Change default vertical alignment of various datatracker tables
    for better readability.

  * From peter.musgrave@magorcorp.com: 
    Fix typo. Fixes #566.

  * From jelte@nlnetlabs.nl: 
    Make search result table headers clickable; clicking will sort on said 
    column, fixes #484.

  * From peter.musgrave@magorcorp.com: 
    Don't show AD/Secretariat links for Last Call etc. if they will 404.
    Fixes #550.

  * From adam@nostrum.com: 
    Meeting boxes now expand to reveal all text when users hover over them.
    Fixes ticket #602. 

  * From kivinen@iki.fi: 
    Added an URL to retrieve a text/plain version of the list of drafts for
    a given WG.  Useful for building WG-speific ePub documents of a WG's
    drafts.

  * From shane@time-travellers.org:
    Updated the JavaScript associated with the search page to 
    control whether the 'search' button is enabled or not. It is
    now enabled if either the main search box has input, or if
    any of the sub-options have input, or both.

  * From rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Adds a view of documents currently in IETF Last Call.  Fixes #630.

  * From bmheight@gmail.com:
    Remove explicit URLs in the code, using reverse() and the newly created
    helper function reverse_lazy().  Fixes #628.

  * From rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Changed the way ballot discuss/comment texts are displayed to
    put the text from current ADs first, and mark ex-ADs with []
    following the convention on the left bar.  This fixes issue #608 

  * From adam@nostrum.com: 
    Added ical-format agenda.  Fixes issue #601.

  * From peter.musgrave@magorcorp.com: 
    Add IPR column to IESG Telechat Agenda.  Fixes issue #552.

  * From rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Add a defer/undefer button to the edit_position dialog.  Fixes issue #627.

  * From kivinen@iki.fi: 
    Changed cookie settings to be valid for 10 years, they used to be valid
    until the end of session.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  28 Mar 2011 19:43:25 +0200

ietfdb (3.13)

  * Provide a full URL to IPR issues in the last call email, rather than just
    the local url path.  Fixes an issue reported by Russ.

  * Tweak the admin interface for WGs and Chairs, adding some useful links 
    to the tabular displays.

  * Add refinements for the liaison admin interface.  Show contact link and 
    coloured Login/User links to show broken entries.

  * Wrap the sdo name query in a try clause to avoid server 500 errors.

  * Only try to populate the liaison user/email list from the from_entity 
    if it's set.

  * Make the document announcement default Cc: somewhat configurable.  
    Remove iab@iab.org (on request).

  * Link to the State help page from the 'State:' label.

  * Don't use '&lt;' and '&gt;' in text/plain email text.

  * Don't permit just any characters in the document name; limit this to 
    characters we currently permit in the names, or which has occurred in 
    posted documents.  Fixes a problem where non-ascii characters were 
    propagated to the database search and caused collation sequence exceptions, 
    instead of giving 404 errors.

  * Remove the To/From/Subject headers from extra headers to prevent 
    duplicate headers.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  26 Mar 2011 09:27:14 +0100

ietfdb (3.12)

  Note: Deploying this release requires a database schema update, see below.

  From esanches@yaco.es:

  * Allow an SDO Liason Manager to send outgoing liaison from any IETF
    Entity to his SDO.

  * Allow the secretariat to send liaisons on behalf of another user.

  * On login, retrieve the person record related to the login from the 
    legacy tables of non IESG logins. Provides the link between login name
    and person listed in the liaison manager table.  Fixes #576.

  * Refined handling of the To: and From: address lists when the Liaison
    Manager is also a WG Chair or AD.

  From henrik@levkowetz.com:

  * Add a clean_whitespace filter in some places to get rid of any newlines 
    embedded in document titles.  Fixes a problem with bad email headers
    in announcements related to documents with newlines embedded in the title.

  * Don't try to send out mail which has no recipients.  Fixes a crash when
    trying to send announcements related to drafts which have an empty
    'email notes to' field.

  * Fix typo in method calls to send email, fixes a crash when submitting
    liaison statements.

  * Renamed 'LiaisonDetail.taken_care' field to 'action_taken'.  
    Miscellaneous associated fixes.  Enhanced liaison-related admin pages.

  Note: Deploying this release requires an additional steps to create
    a new column in a table.  This is done as a South migration
    (see http://south.aeracode.org/ for more info on South):

    # 8<----------
    # First the regular checkout and prepare:

       cd /a/www/ietf-datatracker
       svn co http://svn.tools.ietf.org/svn/tools/ietfdb/tags/3.12
       cp web/ietf/settings_local.py 3.12/ietf/
       cd 3.12

    # Next, apply the migrations:
 
       PYTHONPATH=$PWD ietf/manage.py migrate liaisons

    # Then carry on with the usual actions:

       cd ../
       rm ./web; ln -s 3.12 web
       sudo /etc/init.d/apache restart

    # 8<----------

ietfdb (3.11)

  * Fixed a bug in the IPR Search, where searches against the IPR notice
    content would fail (Only try to open a legacy url if it leads to a
    file; not if it leads to a directory).

  * For a new IESG tracker document, only add a history comment about
    previous history if some previous history exists (i.e., if the replaced 
    document also existed in the IESG tracker).

  * Show status of Dead Expired documents appropriately; just 'Expired' is 
    insufficient.

  * Restore, for the secretariat only, the re-scheduling functionality of 
    the /iesg/agenda/documents/ page which was removed in [2366] as the ADs 
    felt that it made the page too busy.

  * Propagate all extra fields on to the final email sending function, not 
    only the Cc and Bcc fields.  Restores previously missing Reply-To: headers.

  * Turn autoescaping off for everything in text/plain email templates.  Fixes
    multiple problems with '<' and '>' in emails showing up as '&lt;' and
    '&gt;', and related problems.

  * The liaison tool is deployed.  Show the links to the new tool.

  * Prevent things from crashing if some of the email fields are null for a 
    liaison.

  * It should be possible to edit the area of a draft even if it's been set 
    before.  Re-enabled the area list box on the document/edit/info/ page.

  * Corrected spelling error in list_display specification for the 
    PersonOrOrgInfo Admin page.

  * Corrected the path to the draft archive in the settings file.

    (Some of the fixes above has been deployed already before this release
    by patching the previous release on the server.)

ietfdb (3.10)

  * Fix css for IPR header (status column was included by mistake).  Fixes 
    issue #546.

  * Tweak some GUI strings in the Liaison Manager

  From adam@nostrum.com: 

  * Added week-at-a-time view to agenda page when viewing selected areas 
    and/or groups. If no groups are selected, the week view is hidden, leaving the
    base-level functionality unchanged. 

  From peter.musgrave@magorcorp.com: 

  * 548# Link in IPR column should use an absolute, not relative URL.  This 
    fixes issue #546.

  From kivinen@iki.fi: 

  * Added new setting to the /cookies page which enables always showing
    full document text instead of showing beginning of the document. This 
    fixes issue #551.

  From rjsparks@nostrum.com: 

  * Refined the email sent when an position changes.

ietfdb (3.09)

  From suresh.krishnan@ericsson.com: 

  * Added the last call e-mail event to the draft history page. 

  * Added a search function for drafts on their respective mailing lists.
    Fixes issue #458.

  From adam@nostrum.com: 

  * Added tarfile and pdf-composite links and functionality to download
    working group documents from the agenda page. Fixes #539

  From peter.musgrave@magorcorp.com: 

  * Added column 'IPR' to documnet table for WG docs and by AD docs, and also
    in search results. Fixes issue #497.

  From kivinen@iki.fi: 

  * Make the idea of what is 'soon' and 'new' in the I-D and RFC lists
    configurable.

  From lars.eggert@nokia.com: 

  * Fix for #467: History tab: Avoid HTTP/HTTPS warning for the diff tool form
    submission.

  * Fix for #456: Make it possible for an IESG member to add a comment (for
    the document history) in the 'change document state' dialog

  * Fix for #537: Remove redundant "by" info from doc history text.

  * Fix for #525. Adds more information to the document history tab,
    specifically changes to writeup, announcement and last-call text.

  * Fix for #372. Makes the position editing form display the name of the
    document being edited.

  * Fix for #526 and #530: Change the format of the notification email sent
    out when an AD posts a ballot position on a draft, it by default CCs that
    email to the authors and chairs, and adds some explanatory text to the body
    of those messages. 

  From rjsparks@nostrum.com: 

  * Changed the language used in the last call email to be closer to the
    language the tracker uses when no IPR declarations are found directly on the
    draft. Fixes #506

  * Retained search results on login. Fixes #482.

  * Added filename to the subject of Protocol Action and Document Action email
    messages (and fixed a bug that was preventing CC/BCC from being honored).
    Fixes issue #528.

  From fenner@fenron.net: 

  * Split the /doc/ tabs into separate pages. This fixes #533. (Eventually,
    this will use <link rel=prefetch> to ask the tabs to be prefetched when the
    first tab is loaded, as documented at
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Link_prefetching_FAQ, but as there is some
    issues with this which haven't been fully resolved, the prefetch part is not
    part of this release.)

  * Fill in the X-IETF-IDTracker header with the I-D Tracker version number.
    This fixes #513

  * Added support for admin site documentation 

  From henrik@levkowetz.com:

  * Updated IESG Agenda Section 3.3 title

  * Added fix for announcement email multipart bug, in part contributed
    by glen@amsl.com and tony@att.com.

  * Other minor fixes

ietfdb (3.08)

  From olau@iola.dk:

  * Ported scripts for expiration of drafts and last-calls, and sending
    scheduled announcements.

    The command-line front-ends are in bin/ as expire-ids, expire-last-calls
    and send-scheduled-mail. The last one already existed with some code, but
    it's not certain it actually worked. The new one accepts the same arguments
    as the Perl script (there's a little bit of help if you run it).

    All three log to syslog.  They need to be started from cron with
    PYTHONPATH=/a/www/ietf-datatracker/web , in the same manner as other
    scripts which use the django models to interact with the database.

ietfdb (3.07)

  From esanchez@yaco.es:

  * Merged in Yaco's Liaison Management Tool Port & Rewrite.  Enjoy!

  Note: Deploying this release requires additional steps; to verify
  that liaison related settings in settings.py are correct, and to create
  new tables and update existing tables and table content.  The latter
  is done as South migrations (see http://south.aeracode.org/ for more
  info on the South app).  More extensiive documentation about the actions
  needed are provided in the user manual (doc/LSMT_user_manual.pdf in
  the release).  The brief version follows:

    # 8<----------
    # First the regular checkout and prepare:

       cd /a/www/ietf-datatracker
       svn co http://svn.tools.ietf.org/svn/tools/ietfdb/tags/3.07
       cp web/ietf/settings_local.py 3.07/ietf/
       cd 3.07

    # Verify that the new variables in settings.py are correct; if not,
    # add the correct settings in settings_local.py and inform the release
    # manager of the correct settings so they can be incorporated in the
    # next release.  The variables in question are (as set in the release):
    #
    # # The email address from wich all liaison emails come:
    # LIAISON_UNIVERSAL_FROM = 'Liaison Statement Management Tool <lsmt@' + IETF_DOMAIN + '>'
    #
    # # The filesystem path where the liaison attachments will be saved:
    # LIAISON_ATTACH_PATH = '/a/www/ietf-datatracker/documents/LIAISON/'
    #
    # # The url from where the webserver serves the liaison attachments
    # LIAISON_ATTACH_URL = '/documents/LIAISON/'

    # Next, the changes to the MySQL tables will be done.
    # You can list the table migrations which will be applied if desired,
    # this should list migrations from 0001_... to 0009_... under liaisons:

       PYTHONPATH=$PWD ietf/manage.py migrate --list

    # Apply the migrations:
 
       PYTHONPATH=$PWD ietf/manage.py migrate

    # Add the static/doc location as statically served files to the apache
    # configuration.  Fix line 6 in etc/apache2/vhoosts.d/ietf-datatracker.common
    # to read:
    #  <LocationMatch "^/(?!(cgi-bin|css|documents|error|idst|images|js|media|doc|private)/|robots.txt).*$">
    # (i.e., add '|doc' to the exception list).

    # Then carry on with the usual actions:

       cd ../
       rm ./web; ln -s 3.07 web
       sudo /etc/init.d/apache restart

    # 8<----------

  Once the datatracker is up and running with the new liaison tool in
  place, liaison role assignments have to be done as described in
  the LSMT user manual (in doc/LSMT_user_manual.pdf) page 14, summarized
  by Patrik on the yaco-liaison-tool mailing list:

    1. Add the IAB and IETF chairs, wg chairs, area directors etc as
    apropriate (as described in the document).

    2. Add the liaisons in the IETF assigned and named on the IAB list of
    liaisons.

  From rjsparks@nostrum.com:

  * Changed the navigation round editing ballots and sending discuss/email so
    that the user comes back to the page the edit started from.

  * Fix for ticket #374 (all in base.js) and removal of a vestigial 'save all
    changes' button from the iesg/agenda/documents page.

  * Split the ballot writeups page into three pages, for a more
    understandable user interface.

  From henrik@levkowetz.com:

  * Fix a presentation bug in /iesg/agenda/documents.txt

  Bugfix release.  Fixes the following issues (for more details, see the
  release page http://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/ietfdb/milestone/3.05)

  From olau@iola.dk:

  * #354  Document State Change Edit lacks dropdowns in IE 8

  * #359  Test cases fail in fresh checkout from iesg-tracker branch

  * #364  Impossible to move back to No-Position

  * #366  The popup view of current positions when you left click on the
    grids needs to be smarter when it doesn't fit on the display.

  * #369  IDInternal entry with missing information generated

  * #370  Documents marked for telechat not on the web agenda

  From Henrik:

  * #367  Document state age not always shown correctly

  * #355  tarfile generation fails on production system

  * #371  When a draft lacks creation date, the all_id* and 1id_*
    generating script fail

ietfdb (3.04)

  * From Adam Roach: Make the selectable WG agenda feature of the datatracker
    IETF Agenda less resource intensive by not preloading all WG agendas.

  * From Peter Musgrave: Improve the selection of listed 'related documents'
    on the WG document pages.

  * From olau@iola.dk: Fix for issue #351 which caused server error when
    editing the state of a document (as IESG user).

  The following features were included already in v3.03, but by mistake
  weren't listed in the changelog for that revision:

  * IETF 78 Sprint code from Peter Musgrave: Add related documents section to
    the wg documents page (e.g., /wg/sipclf/).

  * IETF 78 Sprint code from Robert Sparks: Relabel the 'Issue Ballot' button
    (for AD use, on the draft info page).

  * IETF 78 Sprint code from Robert Sparks: provide a downloadable tarball of
    the documents on the IESG agenda of a given date.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  28 Jul 2010 16:13:23 +0200

ietfdb (3.03)

  * IETF 78 Sprint code from Adam Roach: Make the IETF agenda page view 
    user-modifiable, providing a custom bookmarkable agenda view for each user.

  * Make WG agendas available trough datatracker URLs; this will avoid 
    problems when the text from these pages are incorporated in frames in other 
    datatracker pages.  Example: /meeting/78/agenda/sipcore

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  27 Jul 2010 15:09:56 +0200

ietfdb (3.02)

  * Remove the per-document rescheduling dropdown boxes from the future iesg
    telechat document list (/iesg/agenda/documents/).  Fixes issue #346.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  21 Jul 2010 15:30:46 +0200

ietfdb (3.01)

  * Add a button to issue a ballot for documents which has entered IESG 
    processing but don't have a ballot yet.

  * Always make idinternal.docstate() return a string -- there are callers 
    that assume this, like the script which generates all_id2.

  * Don't fail with a server error (500) if a bad draft name (containing 
    for instance newlines) is entered -- just return a 404.

  * For WG charters under evaluation, show the year too, not only month and 
    day.  This will reveal bad date information in the charter files.

  * If we fail to parse the date of a WG charter under evaluation, use 1 
    Jan 1900, and carry on.  Don't fail with a server error.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  20 Jul 2010 18:41:31 +0200

ietfdb (3.00)

  * This release adds the IOLA port of the former Perl IESG datatracker to
    the Python/Django datatracker.  This should make most AD actions on
    drafts available through the Django datatracker, normally from the
    datatracker.ietf.org/doc/<draftname>/ page or from the /doc/ad/.../
    page, or expressed UI-wise: from the pages reached from the 'AD Dashboard'
    menu at the top of the lefthand menubar in the datatracker.  This
    includes actions such as:

    - Change draft state
    - Edit draft metadata
    - Defer ballot, undefer ballot
    - Handle ballot comments
    - Handle ballot writeups
    - Approve ballots
    - Initiate last call

    Secretariat staff actions supported through the Django datatracker now
    includes:

    - Manage telechat dates
    - Manage working group descriptions

    Tweaks to the new interface and capabilities will be releases with
    a short release cycle, as they are discovered and fixed over the next
    weeks.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  16 Jul 2010 18:14:48 +0200

ietfdb (2.52)

  * Added machine-readable ballot information (tsv and json) for drafts with
    ballots: /doc/<draftname>/ballot.tsv and /doc/<draftname>/ballot.json .
    Json data for the whole document is available for all drafts at
    /doc/<draftname>/doc.json .

  * Added Unicode NFKC normalization of paths.  Somebody just tried to access 
    /wg/ipfix/charter/ with 'fi' represented as the unicode ligature \ufb01...

  * Changed the text emitted during testing to have less noise at the
    beginning of the line -- only 'OK', 'Fail', and the initial line of coverage
    reports now starts at the beginning of the line, without whitespace.  This
    makes it easier to scan a test run visually to find reported failures.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  16 Jul 2010 13:02:46 +0200

ietfdb (2.51)

  * Add an html sanitizer and a sanitize_html template filter.  This uses
    the html5lib, which has also been included in the svn tree.

  * Provide better handling of both text/plain document comments and 
    document comments which contain html tags.  Adds urlization, 
    linebreak-preservation and html sanitization.  Html sanitization would be 
    better applied when adding comments, but we're not yet a position to 
    enforce this for all input paths.

  * Catch an additional exception which can occur during generation of 
    all_id2.txt

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  07 May 2010 12:26:58 +0200

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  26 Apr 2010 11:45:24 +0200

ietfdb (2.49)

  From Pasi:

  * New script to generate all_id2.txt. This should be called in

  42 4 * * 1 /a/www/ietf-datatracker/web/ietf/bin/notify-expirations

  From Henrik:

  * Adding the south schema migration app (http://south.aeracode.org/).

  * Change the text of IPR search result to more correctly reflect the 
    status of the search result when IPR has been found on documents related to 
    a listed document, but not on that document itself.

  From Pasi:

  * Use the new look for a bunch of additional pages

  * /admin/: fix login redirects to work with RemoteUserMiddleware; hide 
    password changing functionality (which doesn't work with RemoteUser anyway)

  * /ipr/: remove separate list for updating

  * A lot of various code and deployment cleanup

  * A lot of minor tweaks and fixes (tooltips, links, and more)

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  21 Mar 2010 00:36:05 +0100

ietfdb (2.45)

  From Pasi:

  * Use wg_www_pages table (and removed unused idtracker_areaurl).
    Requires applying changes to database as follows:

	cd /a/www/ietf-datatracker/2.45/ietf
	PYTHONPATH=../ python manage.py dbshell < ../test/sql_fixup.sql

  * Parse stream/wg/file formats from rfc-index.xml; prepare for parsing 
    auth48 info from queue2.xml

  * IPR disclosures: Don't include .doc/.html inline; don't fail if file 
    does not exist

  * Replaced /drafts/* with redirects

  * Show datatracker version+date in new look, too

  * IESG discuss page: shade even/odd rows

  * Use new look for IETF meeting agenda; add color-coding support (like 
    tools has).  Also use new look for /iesg/agenda/, /ipr/ and /ipr/NNN/
  * Show RFC publication date as YYYY-MM (since we don't currently have the 
    day)

  * Fix searching for RFCs that are processed by IESG; made 'advanced 
    search' options mutually exclusive

  * For plain text RFCs, point to www.rfc-editor.org instead of www.ietf.org

  * Fix page title for 404/500 pages (ticket:298)


  From Henrik:

  * Apply django changeset 12634 to our copy, to permit usernames 
    containing '@'.  See http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/12634 .

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  11 Mar 2010 14:41:47 +0100

ietfdb (2.44)

  From Robert:

  * Moved old (1995-2003) liaison statements from the template file
    to the database. This requires applying database fixups as
    follows:

        cd /a/www/ietf-datatracker/2.44/ietf
        PYTHONPATH=../ python manage.py dbshell < ../test/liaison_fixup.sql

    And updating the liaison files as follows:

	cd /a/www/ietf-datatracker/documents/LIAISON/
        # TAKE A BACKUP OF THE WHOLE DIRECTORY, JUST IN CASE
	. /a/www/ietf-datatracker/2.44/test/liaison_fixup.sh

  From Pasi:

  * Use new look for more pages

  * Make obsoletes/updates/etc. lists links (with new urlize_ietf_docs 
    template filter)

  * Always show year in /idtracker/status/ dates

  * /doc/rfcNNNN/: show the internet-draft name (if known) and link to its 
    history; show information about post-RFC IESG processing

  * Use yellow for 'abstain' also in /iesg/agenda/documents/

  * IESG ballot grid icon: show 'abstain' as yellow instead of gray

  * IESG telechat agenda: include "private" links also if logged in, link 
    from document list

  * Added /doc/all/ page

  * Better output if /doc/ search doesn't match anything

  * Show state-change-notice-to field in /doc/ (to AD/secretariat)

  * Make IESG telechat agenda feed discoverable

  * Added IPR/dependency links and edit/add buttons for RFCs, too; some 
    template refactoring

  * Avoid exceptions from MySQL when searching for non-ASCII draft names/WG 
    acronyms/etc.

  * Handle non-ASCII characters gracefully in old cgi-bin script redirects

  * IPR search: handle non-numeric RFC numbers/ID document tags gracefully 
    (instead of uncaught exception)

  * Change Atom feeds (+couple of other places) to point to /doc/draft-.. 
    instead of /idtracker/draft-.../

  From Henrik:

  * In PersonOrOrgInfo.email(), try harder to find a relevant email address.
    The new code will eventually fall back to a broad filter which matches that
    of the perl code which creates WG charter pages, where the old code would
    sometimes result in django-generated charter pages with missing email
    addresses.

  * Serve ipr disclosures which are available on the server directly, 
    instead of through an external http link in an <iframe/>.  The <iframe/> 
    method can result in mixing https and http content in the page, which some 
    browser take issue with.

  * Add back in rudimentary Django Admin support which was lost in the 0.96 
    -> 1.1 transition.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  01 Mar 2010 13:17:16 +0100

ietfdb (2.43)

  From Pasi:

  * New main datatracker page!

  * Use normal POST instead of AJAX for search, in order to be able to go
    back to the search result list with the browser back button

  * Added pointers (but no redirect yet) to new pages to /idtracker/ and 
    /idtracker/draft-foo-bar/

  * Added javascript redirect for /drafts/draft-foo-bar/ page

  * Fix history/comment tab for RFCs

  * Added more links to other versions (like tools html)

  * Fixed bug in submitting general license statements

  * Fixed ballot icon width problem in Safari (regression introduced in 
    2.42)

  * Replaced /drafts/all_id.html with redirect (there are no links to it, 
    and according to logs nobody is using it)

  * Added rel=nofollow to various links

  * Improve coloring for "for N days" information

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  01 Mar 2010 13:05:22 +0100

ietfdb (2.42)

  From Pasi:

  * Use an ietf icon in an alternative colour for the new datatracker
    interface.

  * Include 30 items instead of 15 in IPR disclosure atom feed

  * Document page: show IESG telechat date; show state for RFCs (if 
    applicable)

  * Move search button JavaScript to right template file

  * IESG discuss page: better switching between all/by me/for me

  * Less SQL queries for per-document page

  * Moderator package: always show last call end date, fix bug in showing 
    ballot.  Include previous minutes.

  * Show small comment icon (instead of asterisk) when ballot has text.
    Show comment icon also next to discuss/comment text

  * Use a local copy of YUI library instead of pointing to Google CDN (this 
    allows us to work with pure IPv6); upgrade to YUI 2.8.0r4

  * Make RFC editor status a link (to queue)

  * Add link to comments Atom feed

  * Right-click ballot icon to edit your position (when logged in as IESG)

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  26 Jan 2010 11:54:06 +0100

ietfdb (2.41)

  * The 'current agenda' url can fail between meetings, when the 'current 
    meeting number' has been bumped up, but not all relevant information has 
    been entered yet.  Fall back to the most recent meeting for which an agenda 
    can be produced in that case.

  * The self.affiliation() call can sometimes cause an exception, too, due 
    to the deficiencies of the database.  Use something safer as fallback.

  From Pasi:

  * Show various edit buttons only to ADs/secretariat

  * Simplify WG menu a bit

  * Fix comment handling for drafts not in idinternal; use select_related 
    to reduce SQL queries

  * Make sure DOCTYPE is first (without empty lines above it)

  * Use GZipMiddleware for per-document page (result is 25% of original, 
    and loads visibly faster)

  * Close ballot dialog if Escape is pressed

  * Fix ballot dialog not appearing (in new tracker UI)

  * Add timestamp to scribe template

  * Show ballot comments even if AD has no position

  * Improved history tab in "new tracker UI"; per-document page now works 
    better without JavaScript; internal refactoring/cleaning of per-document 
    page

  * Better abstract cleaning (to remove new-style boilerplate)

  * Updated independent submission text to point to RFC 5742 instead of 3932

  * Time out after 30 seconds iwhen downloading

  * Don't indent management item texts (looks a bit nicer)

  * Don't choke on non-ASCII characters in agenda notes

  * Cleaned/simplified left navbar in "new tracker UI"

  * Removed unused HTML (related to the old authentication system)

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  13 Jan 2010 18:25:22 +0100

ietfdb (2.40)

  * Fixed bug in charter templates -- need to test that milestone.done is 
    'Done', as it can also be set to 'No'...

  From Pasi:
  * Added roll call to moderator package; added agenda package email

  * Updated moderator package texts

  * Removed unused image (for the already-retired mailing list request tool)

  * Restrict /iesg/agenda/moderator_package.html to ADs and secretariat

  * Added group_required authentication/authorization decorator

  * Minor refactoring of IESG telechat agenda management item code (to 
    allow access controlled pages in the future)

  * Fix line breaks in IESG telechat moderator package

  * Removed the now-executed commands from sql_fixup.sql

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  04 Dec 2009 12:02:12 +0100

ietfdb (2.39)

  From Pasi:

  * Replaced old authentication/authorization system with a new one
    (which uses Apache's authentication). This requires applying
    database fixups as follows:

        cd /a/www/ietf-datatracker/2.39/ietf
        PYTHONPATH=../ python manage.py dbshell < ../test/sql_fixup.sql
	PYTHONPATH=../ python manage.py syncdb

    And adding something like this to Apache configuration:

	<LocationMatch "^/accounts/login/">
        AuthType Basic
        AuthName "IETF Datatracker"
        AuthUserFile /a/www/htpasswd
	Require valid-user
	</LocationMatch>

  * Fixed ballot icon/etc. to work with the new auth/authz system

  * Fixed escaping in text meeting agenda (ticket #331)

  * Added first beta of IESG telechat moderator package (not fully working 
    yet)

  * Added ASCII version of IESG telechat agenda

    ballot sets)

  * Removed some unused code

  * Replaced non-WG mailing list page with redirect to ietf.org

  * Removed some Django 0.96-only code

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  30 Nov 2009 10:38:41 +0100

ietfdb (2.38)

  Miscellaneous minor fixes:

  * Added differentiating colours for BOF sessions in iPhone agenda
  From Pasi:

  * Added missing safe tags
  * Fixed Russ' email address in mkrelease
  * Updated account information template (fixes exception)
  * Show action items in IESG agenda; updated some links in IESG agenda
  * Fixed a bug in idtracker search (probably introduced by changeset 
    1842); new test case for that
  
 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  12 Nov 2009 04:54:00 +0100

ietfdb (2.37)

  * With this release, the datatracker is changed to run under Django 1.1
    rather than under 0.96, and in this sense it is a major release.  There
    is however very few changes that can be seen by the users, which is the
    reason why there is no major bump in the release number.

  Major changes, from Pasi and the code sprint participants:

  * Imported django/ directory from Django-1.1.1.tar.gz, placed in parallel
    with the top-level ietf/ directory in the tree.  This lets us run with
    a version of Django which could possibly be different than the system
    installed version.

  * Automated conversion of the code base to django-1.1 conventions, e.g.
    to use max_length instead of maxlength in model declarations.

  * Lots of escape and safe filters added to the templates, to handle the
    transition from 0.96 to 1.1.  This work was contributed by a number of
    people durint the IETF 76 code sprint:
	Pasi Eronen (also leading up to the IETF 76 code sprint)
	Tony Hansen
	Ben Campbell
	Tero Kivinen
	Adam Roach
	Arifumi Matsumoto

  * Code cleanup, including removal of unused and seldomly used code (in
    particular the code for mailing list change requests)

  * A lot more test cases added, in preparation for the transition to 1.1;
    also refinement of the testing framework.

  From Lars Eggert:

  * Support the use of UTF-8 in emails

  * Fixed the IPR submission tool to work under Django 1.1

  * Handle persons with non-ASCII names correctly in Django 1.x

  * Improve test coverage for meeting/, idrfc/

  * Use IDInternal.comments method to avoid foreign key problems; support 
    Unicode in jsonify_helper

  From Henrik:

  * Return 404 not found when the wg acronym given as part of a wg charter

    prefix for secretaries (secretaries aren't area secretaries, they're

    refactor and simplify the agenda code and templates.  Requires some database
    changes, too.

  * Made the liaison statement list inherit from base.html, to have the same style

  * Changed to table layout for the base page.  Not puristic, but the non-table

    below the lefthand menu even when there was space higher up), and I could see
    no easy way to fix it.

  * Added the text from the original IPR declaration to the detail page for
    declarations submitted by mail.  Made the link to the email text page more
