  * Add an html sanitizer and a sanitize_html template filter.  This uses
    the html5lib, which has also been included in the svn tree.

  * Provide better handling of both text/plain document comments and 
    document comments which contain html tags.  Adds urlization, 
    linebreak-preservation and html sanitization.  Html sanitization would be 
    better applied when adding comments, but we're not yet a position to 
    enforce this for all input paths.

  * Catch an additional exception which can occur during generation of 
    all_id2.txt

  42 4 * * 1 /a/www/ietf-datatracker/web/ietf/bin/notify-expirations

  From Henrik:

  * Change the text of IPR search result to more correctly reflect the 
    status of the search result when IPR has been found on documents related to 
    a listed document, but not on that document itself.

  From Pasi:

  * Use the new look for a bunch of additional pages

  * /admin/: fix login redirects to work with RemoteUserMiddleware; hide

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  21 Mar 2010 00:36:05 +0100

ietfdb (2.45)

  From Pasi:

  * Use wg_www_pages table (and removed unused idtracker_areaurl).
    Requires applying changes to database as follows:

	cd /a/www/ietf-datatracker/2.45/ietf
	PYTHONPATH=../ python manage.py dbshell < ../test/sql_fixup.sql

  * Parse stream/wg/file formats from rfc-index.xml; prepare for parsing 
    auth48 info from queue2.xml

  * IPR disclosures: Don't include .doc/.html inline; don't fail if file 
    does not exist

  * Replaced /drafts/* with redirects

  * Show datatracker version+date in new look, too

  * IESG discuss page: shade even/odd rows

  * Use new look for IETF meeting agenda; add color-coding support (like 
    tools has).  Also use new look for /iesg/agenda/, /ipr/ and /ipr/NNN/
  * Show RFC publication date as YYYY-MM (since we don't currently have the 
    day)

  * Fix searching for RFCs that are processed by IESG; made 'advanced 
    search' options mutually exclusive

  * For plain text RFCs, point to www.rfc-editor.org instead of www.ietf.org

  * Fix page title for 404/500 pages (ticket:298)


  From Henrik:

  * Apply django changeset 12634 to our copy, to permit usernames 
    containing '@'.  See http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/12634 .

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  11 Mar 2010 14:41:47 +0100

ietfdb (2.44)

  From Robert:

  * Moved old (1995-2003) liaison statements from the template file
    to the database. This requires applying database fixups as
    follows:

        cd /a/www/ietf-datatracker/2.44/ietf
        PYTHONPATH=../ python manage.py dbshell < ../test/liaison_fixup.sql

    And updating the liaison files as follows:

	cd /a/www/ietf-datatracker/documents/LIAISON/
        # TAKE A BACKUP OF THE WHOLE DIRECTORY, JUST IN CASE
	. /a/www/ietf-datatracker/2.44/test/liaison_fixup.sh

  From Pasi:

  * Use new look for more pages

  * Make obsoletes/updates/etc. lists links (with new urlize_ietf_docs 
    template filter)

  * Always show year in /idtracker/status/ dates

  * /doc/rfcNNNN/: show the internet-draft name (if known) and link to its 
    history; show information about post-RFC IESG processing

  * Use yellow for 'abstain' also in /iesg/agenda/documents/

  * IESG ballot grid icon: show 'abstain' as yellow instead of gray

  * IESG telechat agenda: include "private" links also if logged in, link 
    from document list

  * Better output if /doc/ search doesn't match anything

  * Show state-change-notice-to field in /doc/ (to AD/secretariat)

    template refactoring

  * Avoid exceptions from MySQL when searching for non-ASCII draft names/WG 
    acronyms/etc.

  * Handle non-ASCII characters gracefully in old cgi-bin script redirects

  * IPR search: handle non-numeric RFC numbers/ID document tags gracefully 
    (instead of uncaught exception)

  * Change Atom feeds (+couple of other places) to point to /doc/draft-.. 
    instead of /idtracker/draft-.../

  From Henrik:

  * In PersonOrOrgInfo.email(), try harder to find a relevant email address.
    The new code will eventually fall back to a broad filter which matches that
    of the perl code which creates WG charter pages, where the old code would
    sometimes result in django-generated charter pages with missing email
    addresses.

  * Serve ipr disclosures which are available on the server directly, 
    instead of through an external http link in an <iframe/>.  The <iframe/> 
    method can result in mixing https and http content in the page, which some 
    browser take issue with.

  * Add back in rudimentary Django Admin support which was lost in the 0.96 
    -> 1.1 transition.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  01 Mar 2010 13:17:16 +0100

    /idtracker/draft-foo-bar/

  * Added javascript redirect for /drafts/draft-foo-bar/ page

  * Fixed bug in submitting general license statements

  * Fixed ballot icon width problem in Safari (regression introduced in

    and according to logs nobody is using it)

  * Added rel=nofollow to various links

  * Improve coloring for "for N days" information

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  01 Mar 2010 13:05:22 +0100

ietfdb (2.42)

  From Pasi:

  * Use an ietf icon in an alternative colour for the new datatracker
    interface.

  * Document page: show IESG telechat date; show state for RFCs (if 
    applicable)

  * Move search button JavaScript to right template file

  * IESG discuss page: better switching between all/by me/for me

  * Less SQL queries for per-document page

  * Moderator package: always show last call end date, fix bug in showing 
    ballot.  Include previous minutes.

  * Show small comment icon (instead of asterisk) when ballot has text.
    Show comment icon also next to discuss/comment text

  * Use a local copy of YUI library instead of pointing to Google CDN (this 
    allows us to work with pure IPv6); upgrade to YUI 2.8.0r4

  * Make RFC editor status a link (to queue)

  * Add link to comments Atom feed

  * Right-click ballot icon to edit your position (when logged in as IESG)

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  26 Jan 2010 11:54:06 +0100

ietfdb (2.41)

  * The 'current agenda' url can fail between meetings, when the 'current 
    meeting number' has been bumped up, but not all relevant information has 
    been entered yet.  Fall back to the most recent meeting for which an agenda 
    can be produced in that case.

  * The self.affiliation() call can sometimes cause an exception, too, due 
    to the deficiencies of the database.  Use something safer as fallback.

  From Pasi:

  * Show various edit buttons only to ADs/secretariat

  * Simplify WG menu a bit

  * Fix comment handling for drafts not in idinternal; use select_related 
    to reduce SQL queries

  * Make sure DOCTYPE is first (without empty lines above it)

  * Use GZipMiddleware for per-document page (result is 25% of original, 
    and loads visibly faster)

  * Close ballot dialog if Escape is pressed

  * Fix ballot dialog not appearing (in new tracker UI)

  * Add timestamp to scribe template

  * Show ballot comments even if AD has no position

  * Cleaned/simplified left navbar in "new tracker UI"

  * Removed unused HTML (related to the old authentication system)

    'Done', as it can also be set to 'No'...

  From Pasi:
  * Added roll call to moderator package; added agenda package email

  * Updated moderator package texts

  * Removed unused image (for the already-retired mailing list request tool)

  * Restrict /iesg/agenda/moderator_package.html to ADs and secretariat

  * Added group_required authentication/authorization decorator

  * Minor refactoring of IESG telechat agenda management item code (to 
    allow access controlled pages in the future)

  * Fix line breaks in IESG telechat moderator package

  * Removed the now-executed commands from sql_fixup.sql

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  04 Dec 2009 12:02:12 +0100

ietfdb (2.39)

  From Pasi:

  * Replaced old authentication/authorization system with a new one
    (which uses Apache's authentication). This requires applying
    database fixups as follows:

        cd /a/www/ietf-datatracker/2.39/ietf
        PYTHONPATH=../ python manage.py dbshell < ../test/sql_fixup.sql
	PYTHONPATH=../ python manage.py syncdb

    And adding something like this to Apache configuration:

	<LocationMatch "^/accounts/login/">
        AuthType Basic
        AuthName "IETF Datatracker"
        AuthUserFile /a/www/htpasswd
	Require valid-user
	</LocationMatch>

  * Fixed ballot icon/etc. to work with the new auth/authz system

  * Added first beta of IESG telechat moderator package (not fully working 
    yet)

ietfdb (2.37)

  * With this release, the datatracker is changed to run under Django 1.1
    rather than under 0.96, and in this sense it is a major release.  There
    is however very few changes that can be seen by the users, which is the
    reason why there is no major bump in the release number.

  Major changes, from Pasi and the code sprint participants:

  * Imported django/ directory from Django-1.1.1.tar.gz, placed in parallel
    with the top-level ietf/ directory in the tree.  This lets us run with
    a version of Django which could possibly be different than the system
    installed version.

  * Automated conversion of the code base to django-1.1 conventions, e.g.
    to use max_length instead of maxlength in model declarations.

  * Lots of escape and safe filters added to the templates, to handle the
    transition from 0.96 to 1.1.  This work was contributed by a number of
    people durint the IETF 76 code sprint:
	Pasi Eronen (also leading up to the IETF 76 code sprint)
	Tony Hansen
	Ben Campbell
	Tero Kivinen
	Adam Roach
	Arifumi Matsumoto

  * Code cleanup, including removal of unused and seldomly used code (in
    particular the code for mailing list change requests)

  * A lot more test cases added, in preparation for the transition to 1.1;
    also refinement of the testing framework.

  From Lars Eggert:

  * Support the use of UTF-8 in emails

  * Fixed the IPR submission tool to work under Django 1.1

  * Handle persons with non-ASCII names correctly in Django 1.x

  * Improve test coverage for meeting/, idrfc/

  * Multiple bugfixes for days-in-state information

    because the foreign key isn't really a foreign key

  * Fix author name (Unicode) and pubdate (datetime vs. date) for Django 1.x

  * Use IDInternal.comments method to avoid foreign key problems; support 
    Unicode in jsonify_helper

  From Henrik:

  * Return 404 not found when the wg acronym given as part of a wg charter

    feed break if that happens.

  * Add debian-style control file with metainformation.

ietfdb (2.32)

  * Make the 1wg-charters.txt page stable, not changing dependent on the
    order in which the database backend returns records.

  * Various fixes to the new charter page generation.  Removed the area
    prefix for secretaries (secretaries aren't area secretaries, they're
    secretaries to the group).  Added tech advisors and WG editors.
    Fixed html for secretary lists.

  * Fixed link in Slides model (should be moved to templates, I suspect)
    which has changed since ietf-74.  Todo: Should be made consistent in
    the archives, or failing that, be dependent on the meeting number
    (ugh!).

  * Show correct days-in-state information (hopefully). From Pasi.

  * Cleaning of IPR disclosure submission form internals  
    to simplify Django 1.0 transition.  From Jelte and Pasi.

    which is used to produce the individual WG charter.txt and charter.html
    pages, and also used by the script which produces 1wg-charters.txt.

  * Also merged in Arifumi and RjS' rewrite of the script which produces
    1wg-charters.txt.

ietfdb (2.23)

  * Fixed a wrong link in the html agenda (from Henrik)

  * Removed the explicit database server ip address in settings.py
    (from Henrik)

  * Integrated updated authorization system.  This requires applying
    database fixups as follows:

	python manage.py dbshell < ../test/sql_fixup.sql

    The existing htpasswd file can be imported into this new system
    as follows:

	export PYTHONPATH=/a/www/ietf-datatracker/2.23
	export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=ietf.settings
	/a/www/ietf-datatracker/2.23/ietf/bin/import-users /a/www/htpasswd

    help us resolve any troubles that users have.

    refactor and simplify the agenda code and templates.  Requires some database
    changes, too.

  * Made the liaison statement list inherit from base.html, to have the same style

  * Changed to table layout for the base page.  Not puristic, but the non-table

    below the lefthand menu even when there was space higher up), and I could see
    no easy way to fix it.

  * Added the text from the original IPR declaration to the detail page for
    declarations submitted by mail.  Made the link to the email text page more
    prominent. Fixed some html issues.

    fixes to the html.

  * Added more people to the autogenerated release mail.

  * Added to the mkrelease script the generation of a mail about the
    release to various interested parties.

    from Pasi Eronen <pasi.eronen@nokia.com>

    hardcoded IP address when it should be empty.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  06 Nov 2008 17:20:49 +0100

ietfdb (2.11)

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  06 Nov 2008 17:20:49 +0100

ietfdb (2.10)

    style sheet, and using a more consistent style, and introducing a
    lefthand menubar.

    information.  Tweaked the format of returned docstate information
    to not have spaces around the :: separator between state and substate.

    which no longer was correct.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  06 Nov 2008 17:20:49 +0100

  * Adjustments to the default settings, to match the new deployment environment
    at AMS

  * Template updates for agendas: 
      - Use python, not template-language, to decide if the month is
	different.  
      - Don't use "odate" and add a space where   appropriate.  
      - Use a datetime and time zone instead of hardcoding (ET).
	(let the model combine the date and the time)

  * Per suggestion from John Klensin, add a link directly to the text of the
    I-D, but only give the explicit link to the draft if it's active.

  * Expanded description of a document on the agenda.

  * Added authorization infrastructure.  No impact on current functionality,
    but needed for future features.

    interface for iesg_login and irtf rg's and chairs.

  * /meeting/ now redirects to meeting/<current>/materials.html

  * Licencing information added.  IETF Trust copyright added as needed.
