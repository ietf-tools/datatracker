id2xml (0.9.2) ietf; urgency=low

  This pre-release fixes additional issues reported by rjsparks@nostrum.com
  during initial testing.  From the changelog:

  * Added makefile rules to make diff comparison tests between original and 
    generated .txt files, and some baseline diffs.

  * Tweaked script message formatting slightly

  * Added some config default values.  Tweaked the command-line switches.  
    Generalized the handling of recognized non-numbered section names, 
    including some code refactoring and simplification.  Added recognition of 
    additional reference formats in the reference sections.  Added debug output 
    methods which can be selectively switched on or off, per parser entity 
    function, from the command line; with some related refactoring of the 
    options handling.

  * Added support for .id2xmlrc config files.  Added support for 
    symrefs='no'.  Fixed a bug which could cause a divide-by-zero error.  Added 
    --debug and --quiet options.  Changed conversion error messages to only 
    show traceback when --debug is set.  Added handling of Figure and Table 
    titles that only number the figure/table, without providing a title text.

  * Added some fixes for older documents, and documents with many authors.

id2xml (0.9.1) ietf; urgency=low

  This pre-release fixes some issues reported by rjsparks@nostrum.com
  during initial testing, and by housley@vigilsec.com during text review:

  * Fixed some issues found for draft-sparks-genarea-review-tracker-03.txt: 
    Use of 'Work in Progress' annotation for non-draft references, code/figure 
    text indented less than 3 spaces.

  * Fixed a number of issues found for rfc7842: Use of None instead of 
    blank string as null input to skip(); failed to accept spelling 
    'acknowledgment', failed to set attribute 'numbered' to 'no' for back 
    matter sections which were not numbered.

  * Updated readme based on feedback from housley@vigilsec.com

id2xml (0.9.0) ietf; urgency=low

  This is the first public release.  Recent changes:

  * New readme text, more appropriate as pypi description.

  * Increased the version number before pre-release, and added an upload: 
    target to the makefile.

  * Fixed an issue with identifying URIs sections, and tweaked the symbol 
    ratio limit between figures and t/list items.

  * Rearranged id2xml as a package instead of as a single-file module, in 
    order to be able to enclose the v2 and v3 .rnc and .rng files (and possibly 
    other data files in the future).  Added LICENCE, README and MANIFEST files. 

  * Changed argument parsing to use argparse, and changed the Makefile to 
    process the new help text into something txt2man can use to produce a 
    manpage.

  * Removed the local command-line script

  * Moved the bulk of the command-line invocation code from id2xml to 
    id2xml.run(), in order to support general setuptools script installation.  
    Added recognition of 'URIs' sections generated from erefs.  Added a 
    setup.py file and other supporting files to enable pip and setuptools 
    installation.

  * Added a guard against overwriting what could be the xml file.  Added 
    wrapping of warning and error messages.

  * Added -o (output file) and -p (output path) options to the invocation 
    script, and tweaked the --help output.

  * Fixed an issue with identification of sublists to lists, an issue with 
    joining some URLs broken across lines, and an issue with wrong column 
    settings when extracting table columns.

  * Improved eref support, some refactoring.

  * Added processing of erefs and xrefs to reference entries.

  * Stable point: parsing front, back, and sections in place; generated xml 
    produces text that matches original well when run through xml2rfc.  Major 
    missing piece: parsing of text paragraphs to provide xref elements.
